# jaggaer-api
Code for interacting with the Jaggaer APIs, part of integration with the UCLA campus financial system.

# Project suspended July 2024
This project is "on pause" indefinitely - see [archived bruinpost](https://ucla.app.box.com/s/0uw8i1soyqmk952pph0ekpty2xr1ujxu) for more info.

Code in this repository is alpha-level work in progress, does not work correctly, and should not be used for anything. It's only here in case it's needed if / when this project resumes.

### Secrets file

The client imports secrets from `jaggaer_secrets.py`, which must be created locally.
```
client_id = "SOME_VALUE"
client_secret = "SOME_VALUE"
host = "SOME_VALUE"
```

### Sample data

Files in `sample_data` directory were being used during development.  They almost certainly will need to be replaced / refreshed if this project resumes.
